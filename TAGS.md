### 1. **What is an HTML Tag?**

HTML tags are the building blocks of a webpage. They define how content is displayed in the browser. Each tag starts with a less-than symbol (`<`) and ends with a greater-than symbol (`>`). Most tags have opening and closing pairs.

**Basic Tag Structure:**
```html
<tagname>Content goes here</tagname>
```

- **Opening Tag**: `<tagname>`
- **Closing Tag**: `</tagname>`
- **Content**: What is between the opening and closing tags

For example:
```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

In the example above:
- The tag name is `p` (for paragraph).
- The opening tag is `<p>`.
- The closing tag is `</p>`.
- The content inside the tags is the text "This is a paragraph."

**Exercise 1**:
- Create an HTML document with a heading (`<h1>`) and a paragraph (`<p>`).

### 2. **The Structure of an HTML Document**

A basic HTML document has a specific structure that includes several required tags.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a basic HTML document.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

- **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: Declares the document type as HTML5.
- **`<html>`**: The root element that wraps all HTML content.
- **`<head>`**: Contains metadata (like the title, character set, etc.) that is not displayed on the page.
- **`<title>`**: Sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab.
- **`<body>`**: Contains the content that is visible on the webpage.

**Exercise 2**:
- Create an HTML document that includes a title and some text in the body using an `<h1>` tag and a `<p>` tag.

### 3. **Types of HTML Tags**

#### a. **Block-Level Tags**
Block-level tags take up the full width of their parent element and start on a new line.

Examples of block-level tags:
- `<div>`: A generic container tag.
- `<p>`: Paragraphs.
- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Headings of various levels.
- `<ul>`: Unordered lists.
- `<ol>`: Ordered lists.

```html
<div>
  <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph inside a block-level tag.</p>
</div>
```

#### b. **Inline Tags**
Inline tags only take up as much space as necessary and do not start on a new line.

Examples of inline tags:
- `<span>`: A generic inline container.
- `<a>`: Links.
- `<img>`: Images.
- `<strong>`: Bold text.

```html
<p>This is an <strong>important</strong> piece of text.</p>
```

**Exercise 3**:
- Create an HTML document that uses both block-level and inline tags. For instance, a heading, a paragraph, and some bold text within the paragraph.

### 4. **Attributes of HTML Tags**

HTML tags can have **attributes** that provide additional information about the element. Attributes are always included inside the opening tag and are written as name/value pairs, like this: `name="value"`.

Common attributes:
- **`id`**: A unique identifier for an element.
- **`class`**: A class name that can be used to group elements.
- **`style`**: Inline CSS to style the element.
- **`href`**: Specifies the link for `<a>` tags.
- **`src`**: Specifies the source for `<img>` tags.

```html
<a href="https://example.com" id="myLink" class="external-link">Click here</a>
```

In the example above:
- `href`: Specifies the destination URL.
- `id`: A unique identifier for the link.
- `class`: A class name used for grouping and styling.

**Exercise 4**:
- Create a link (`<a>`) with an `href` attribute that links to your favorite website.

### 5. **Nesting HTML Tags**

HTML tags can be nested inside other tags. This helps structure the document more effectively. However, tags must be closed in the correct order.

```html
<div>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>This is a <strong>bold</strong> statement in a paragraph.</p>
</div>
```

- The `<strong>` tag is nested inside the `<p>` tag.
- The `<p>` tag is nested inside the `<div>` tag.

**Exercise 5**:
- Create an HTML document that has nested tags like the example above. Include a heading, a paragraph, and some bold text within the paragraph.

### 6. **Semantic vs. Non-Semantic Tags**

Semantic tags clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. Non-semantic tags don’t convey any specific meaning.

#### **Semantic Tags**:
- `<header>`: Represents the header of a document or section.
- `<article>`: Represents an independent piece of content.
- `<section>`: Defines sections in a document.
- `<footer>`: Represents the footer of a document.

```html
<header>
  <h1>My Website</h1>
</header>
<section>
  <article>
    <h2>Article Title</h2>
    <p>This is some content within the article.</p>
  </article>
</section>
<footer>
  <p>&copy; 2024 My Website</p>
</footer>
```

#### **Non-Semantic Tags**:
- `<div>`: A generic container with no specific meaning.
- `<span>`: A generic inline container with no specific meaning.

```html
<div>
  <p>This is a non-semantic container using a <span>span</span> tag.</p>
</div>
```

**Exercise 6**:
- Create a webpage using semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`. Include a heading, an article, and some text.

### 7. **Self-Closing Tags**

Some HTML tags are **self-closing**, meaning they do not require a closing tag. Self-closing tags are typically used for elements that do not contain content, such as images or line breaks.

Examples of self-closing tags:
- `<img>`: Displays an image.
- `<br>`: Inserts a line break.
- `<hr>`: Inserts a horizontal line.

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Sample Image">
<br>
<hr>
```

**Exercise 7**:
- Create an HTML page that includes an image, a line break, and a horizontal line.

### 8. **Common HTML Tags with Examples**

Here are some of the most common HTML tags you’ll encounter:

- **`<h1> to <h6>`**: Headings
  ```html
  <h1>This is a top-level heading</h1>
  <h2>This is a second-level heading</h2>
  ```

- **`<p>`**: Paragraph
  ```html
  <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
  ```

- **`<a>`**: Anchor (link)
  ```html
  <a href="https://example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
  ```

- **`<img>`**: Image
  ```html
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Sample Image">
  ```

- **`<ul>` and `<ol>`**: Unordered and ordered lists
  ```html
  <ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    <li>First item</li>
    <li>Second item</li>
  </ol>
  ```

- **`<table>`**: Table
  ```html
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Header 1</th>
      <th>Header 2</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data 1</td>
      <td>Data 2</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  ```

### 9. **Final Exercise**

Create a complete HTML webpage that includes:
- A title
- A header (`<header>`)
- A section with an article (`<section>` and `<article>`)
- A paragraph of text
- A link to another page (`<a>`)
- An image (`<img>`)
- An unordered list (`<ul>`)
- A footer (`<footer>`)

By the end of this lesson,

 you will have gained a comprehensive understanding of HTML tags and how to structure a basic webpage.

This detailed guide covers all the essential concepts of HTML tags and provides hands-on practice to build your knowledge.


### ADVANCED

The lesson provided covers the core concepts and common use cases of HTML tags, but there are a few additional advanced or less common topics that could be included for more comprehensive coverage. Here are a few more things that can be added to ensure it covers **everything** about HTML tags:

### 1. **Global Attributes**

Certain attributes are available for every HTML tag, known as **global attributes**. These attributes can be applied to any element to modify its behavior or provide extra functionality.

Some important global attributes:
- **`class`**: Applies one or more class names to an element.
- **`id`**: Provides a unique identifier for the element.
- **`style`**: Inline CSS for the element.
- **`data-*`**: Stores custom data attributes.
- **`title`**: Provides additional information, often displayed as a tooltip.
- **`tabindex`**: Specifies the tab order of an element for keyboard navigation.
- **`hidden`**: Hides the element from view.
- **`lang`**: Specifies the language of the element's content.
  
Example:
```html
<p id="intro" class="highlight" style="color: blue;" data-info="custom-data" title="This is a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>
```

**Exercise**: 
- Create a paragraph that uses global attributes such as `id`, `class`, `title`, and `data-*` to customize its behavior.

### 2. **Event Attributes**

HTML supports **event attributes**, which allow you to trigger JavaScript when certain events occur (e.g., clicking, hovering, loading). These attributes are attached directly to elements.

Common event attributes:
- **`onclick`**: Fires when an element is clicked.
- **`onmouseover`**: Fires when the mouse pointer hovers over an element.
- **`onload`**: Fires when the page or element has finished loading.
  
Example:
```html
<button onclick="alert('Button clicked!')">Click me</button>
```

**Exercise**: 
- Create a button that triggers an alert when clicked.

### 3. **Deprecated Tags**

Over time, some HTML tags have become obsolete or replaced by newer, more semantic tags. These are known as **deprecated tags**. It’s essential to know these so you can avoid using them in modern HTML.

Examples:
- `<center>`: Used to center text (now replaced by CSS).
- `<font>`: Used to define font size and color (now handled by CSS).
- `<b>` and `<i>`: Used to bold or italicize text (replaced by `<strong>` and `<em>` for semantic purposes).

Example:
```html
<p><center>This is deprecated content</center></p>
```

**Exercise**: 
- Identify and replace deprecated tags with their modern counterparts in an HTML document.

### 4. **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) Tags**

ARIA tags are used to improve the accessibility of web pages for users with disabilities. They provide additional context for assistive technologies like screen readers.

Examples of ARIA attributes:
- **`aria-label`**: Defines a label for an element.
- **`aria-hidden`**: Hides an element from screen readers.
- **`role`**: Defines the role of an element (e.g., `navigation`, `button`).

Example:
```html
<button aria-label="Submit Form">Submit</button>
```

**Exercise**:
- Add ARIA attributes to a form to improve accessibility.

### 5. **Custom Data Attributes (`data-*`)**

You can define custom attributes using the `data-*` attribute. These attributes are particularly useful for storing information within HTML elements that can be accessed by JavaScript.

Example:
```html
<div data-user-id="12345">User Information</div>
```

In JavaScript, you can access this data with:
```javascript
var userId = document.querySelector('div').dataset.userId;
```

**Exercise**: 
- Create a custom attribute (`data-*`) and retrieve its value using JavaScript.

### 6. **Void Elements**

While we discussed self-closing tags, **void elements** are those that don’t contain any content and don’t require a closing tag. These are sometimes confused with self-closing tags.

Void elements include:
- `<area>`
- `<base>`
- `<br>`
- `<col>`
- `<embed>`
- `<hr>`
- `<img>`
- `<input>`
- `<link>`
- `<meta>`
- `<source>`

Example:
```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A sample image">
<hr>
```

### 7. **The `<!DOCTYPE>` Declaration**

Although covered briefly, it's important to note that the `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration informs the browser about the version of HTML you're using. It must be the first thing in the document before the `<html>` tag.

The declaration for HTML5 is:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

For older versions of HTML, different declarations exist (e.g., HTML 4.01, XHTML).

### 8. **Meta Tags**

**Meta tags** provide metadata about an HTML document. They go inside the `<head>` element and offer important information, such as character set, viewport settings, description, and keywords for search engines.

Common meta tags:
- **`<meta charset="UTF-8">`**: Specifies the character encoding.
- **`<meta name="description" content="A brief description of the webpage.">`**: Provides a summary for search engines.
- **`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`**: Ensures the page is responsive.

Example:
```html
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="description" content="This is a sample webpage">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
</head>
```

**Exercise**: 
- Add meta tags for character encoding, description, and viewport to an HTML document.
